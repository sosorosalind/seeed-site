        <p> Demba Nabé, rapper and singer for Berlin band Seeed, has died in the German capital at the age of 46. The musician passed away on Thursday morning, said Christian Schertz, the band's lawyer.
          "Demba's death has hit the band deeply," Schertz told the Tagesspiegel newspaper, adding that Seeed needed time to grieve and that they would not, for now, answer any further questions about the circumstances of Nabé's death.
          A single post was left on the Seeed Facebook page regarding the death of the long-time band member who was born in Berlin in 1972: "We mourn our friend and singer Demba Nabé." Nabé built his career with Seeed, an 11-member dancehall and
          reggae band that was famed for high energy live performances since forming in 1998. In 2001, the band released the massive hit song "Dickes B" (Big B), an ode to the city of Berlin. The band have been successful beyond Germany's borders,
          headlining the likes of Denmark's Roskilde Festival.</p>

      Seeed is a German hip hop, reggae and dancehall band based in Berlin. Founded in 1998, they have become well known in Germany and its neighboring countries.
      Seeed consists of eleven band members, including three singers, a horn section and a DJ. Seeed is recognized for their catchy fusional mix of German HipHop, Reggae and Dancehall styles and their use of horns, which is unusual in contemporary
      popular music. They have worked with Cee-Lo Green, Anthony B, Tanya Stephens, General Degree as well as other Jamaican artists and producers. Almost all of their music releases feature a popular guest experience. Seeed's lyrics are in German,
      English and Patois. Their biggest hits in the German Sprachraum were "Dickes B", "Aufstehn", "Ding" and "Music Monks". Although their lyrics are in English and German, most of the songs in German were completely translated into English for the
      international releases of the Albums Next! and Music Monks.
      Their first hit was "Dickes B", an ode to Berlin. They won three ECHO Awards. With the international versions of Music Monks and Next!, they found broader success in Germany's neighboring countries, especially France. After their initial
      success with "Dickes B", in the year 2000, they released their first full-length album a few months later, in 2001: New Dubby Conquerors.
      In September 2012, Seeed released their fourth studio album, Seeed, their first release in six years. In the mean time, members Peter Fox, Dellé and Demba Nabé (Boundzound) each released solo albums. The album Seeed went straight to number 1
      in the German Albums Chart. It was the first time an album of Seeed achieved the top of the albums chart.
